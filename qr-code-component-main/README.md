## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am familiar enough with HTML and CSS to have completed this with few issues but this was the first time building something from a premade example and trying to match it exactly. Choosing pixel sizes was to match was the most difficult part of the project.

### Continued development

Calculating exact pixel sizes is something I need to work on more.
